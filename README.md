# NAME

Prometheus::Tiny - A tiny Prometheus client

# SYNOPSIS

    use Prometheus::Tiny;

    my $prom = Prometheus::Tiny->new;
    $prom->set('some_metric', 5, { some_label => "aaa" });
    print $prom->format;

# DESCRIPTION

`Prometheus::Tiny` is a minimal metrics client for the
[Prometheus](http://prometheus.io/) time-series database.

It does the following things differently to [Net::Prometheus](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Prometheus):

- No setup. You don't need to pre-declare metrics to get something useful.
- Labels are passed in a hash. Positional parameters get awkward.
- No inbuilt collectors, PSGI apps, etc. Just the metrics.
- Doesn't know anything about different metric types. You get what you ask for.

These could all be pros or cons, depending on what you need. For me, I needed a
compact base that I could back on a shared memory region. See
[Prometheus::Tiny::Shared](https://metacpan.org/pod/Prometheus::Tiny::Shared) for that!

# CONSTRUCTOR

## new

    my $prom = Prometheus::Tiny->new

# METHODS

## set

    $prom->set($name, $value, { labels })

Set the value for the named metric. The labels hashref is optional.

## add

    $prom->add($name, $amount, { labels })

Add the given amount to the already-stored value (or 0 if it doesn't exist). The labels hashref is optional.

## inc

    $prom->inc($name, { labels })

A shortcut for

    $prom->add($name, 1, { labels })

## dec

    $prom->dec($name, { labels })

A shortcut for

    $prom->add($name, -1, { labels })

## declare

    $prom->declare($name, help => $help, type => $type)

"Declare" a metric by setting its help text or type.

## format

    my $metrics = $prom->format

Output the stored metrics, values, help text and types in the [Prometheus exposition format](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/master/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md).

## psgi

    use Plack::Builder;
    builder {
      mount "/metrics" => $prom->psgi;
    };

Returns a simple PSGI app that, when hooked up to a web server and called, will
return formatted metrics for Prometheus. This is little more than a wrapper
around `format`, namely:

    sub app {
      my $env = shift;
      return [ 200, [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ], [ $prom->format ] ];
    }

This is just a convenience; if you already have a web server or you want to
ship metrics via some other means (eg the Node Exporter's textfile collector),
just use `format`.
